###### PS: When I firstly tried to install the AdventureWorks2012 database to SQL Sever 2012, I got the Error 5133. It is because that the SQL Server sometimes cannot find the right path of the file. To solve the problem, I manually set the file path by clicking the '...' icon in the Current File Path column.
